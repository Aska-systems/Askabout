> The opinion of collaborating with the local community is not just popular but is also gathering votes from respondents with various response patterns. However, it is unclear who is responsible for taking action, and it lacks specificity, so it would have been better to clarify who the subject is in the question. Specific ideas such as “Develop green certification programs for accommodations” and “Ensure fair wages for workers in the tourism industry” have been proposed, but these have not gathered votes. Ideas like “Collaborate with stakeholders to promote responsible travel behaviors” and “Implement regulations to control tourist influx” are interesting as they reflect the current issue of overtourism in major tourist destinations.
