> While other SDGs issues tend to attract votes for technical actions, for this goal, many proposals focus on awareness-raising activities and rule-making to encourage changes in consciousness for saving energy, and these have ended up being popular responses. The number of proposed opinions is fewer compared to other issues. Furthermore, the considerable overlap in content means that there is actually even less variety in the opinions that have emerged.

> The responses can be classified into several groups: public awareness and education, government incentives, and investment in technology and infrastructure. The highest votes emphasize public awareness and education, followed by investment in innovative technologies and governmental incentives. Specific infrastructural improvements and international cooperation also received notable attention. Overall, the trend indicates a prioritization of education and awareness initiatives combined with technological investments to double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency by 2030.

## Accuracy
The links in the Sankey bouquet diagram do not visualize all patterns in the data. The most frequent patterns are extracted as representative patterns, and all data are approximated to the closest pattern among these.
