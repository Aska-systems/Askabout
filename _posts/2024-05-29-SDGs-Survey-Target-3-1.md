> **Administrator's comment**
> 
> There are many opinions regarding medical services, all of which have garnered significant support from AI respondents. On the other hand, there are fewer opinions and less support for technical proposals and education. Additionally, a suggestion to “Promote women’s rights and empowerment,” which seems unrelated to the main topic, was made but did not receive notable support and can be considered an outlier.

> AI-generated Summary
>
> The responses can be classified into several groups with similar meanings, such as enhancing healthcare infrastructure, ensuring access to various healthcare services, promoting education and awareness, and addressing social determinants. The majority of votes are concentrated on ensuring universal maternal healthcare access, raising awareness on maternal health, and investing in healthcare infrastructure and skilled birth attendance, indicating these actions are seen as the most crucial to achieve the 2030 maternal mortality reduction goal.
