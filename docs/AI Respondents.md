# AI Respondents

## Who Are They?
AI respondents are language model agents instructed to provide responses similar to those of human respondents. Each AI respondent is mutually independent.

## AI Respondents Are Not a Substitute for Humans.
The opinions and responses by AI respondents are not meant to replace human responses. Even when the AI respondents are attributed with demographic information, there is no guarantee that their opinions and responses align with those of human respondents with the same attributes. They simply reflect how language models reacted to a provided question at the time the survey was conducted and should be valued in their own right.

## Can We Expect Them to Align with Human Respondents?
It depends on the question asked and the version of the language model used. If you believe that the responses from AI respondents are typical of human responses, then you can use them as a hypothesis for your survey.
